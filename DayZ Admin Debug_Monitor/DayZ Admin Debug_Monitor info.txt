The DayZ Admin Debug_Monitor is a Version of DayZ Debug_Monitor that gives admins a special extended debug monitor
while giving normal players the regular version (non-admin), It is kept up to date by myself Hayward (aka UrbanSkaters).

This version is for Chernarus, but should also work with other maps (back up your original files before testing).

I accept no responsibility for any damage or downtime this script may cuase to your server.  
The script has been tested and confirmed to be working by both admins and regular users on my server.
If you do not understand any of my instructions below, then please contact me: urbanskaters@gmail.com

UPDATE: Both versions have been tested by admins and regular users and confirmed to be working.



These instructions assume you already know how to unpack your mission.pbo, if not please Google for more information.

Instructions

######

First things first, merge the included init.sqf with your own mission init.sqf file (remember to do the Instance Number). 

You DO NOT need the mission.sqm or description.ext files, these are just to complete the mission folder structure.
You should have your own, but if you haven't, then use these instead (they only work with Chernarus though)

Copy the debug folder to your mission folder, along with the merged init.sqf (if you haven't done so already)

You will need to make changes to the following file, depending on which version you're using:

For the Trigger Version: debug\playerstats.sqf (line 13)
  and
For the Always On Version: debug\player_spawn_2.sqf (line 284)

Look for this code on those lines: if ((getPlayerUID vehicle player) in ["25517190","24681"])

And change the UIDs to those of yours and your admin(s). 
To add more UIDS simply put a comma at the end of the last UID and add another UID in brackets..
So adding a new UID to the above example would look like this ["25517190","24681","998877"]

#######

If you want to see what the non-admin debug monitor looks like, then simply ommit your UID from the list.  
Remember that only the UID's you add manually will see the Admin debug monitor. 

To set a hotkey for your Debug Monitor (if one isn't already set), go to:

Options > Controls > Custom Controls (click on the white pull down menu) > (assing a hotkey to User Action 20)

FYI: Some people are advising me that you can press H to get the debug monitor up, but it is worth
noting that the H key will only bring up a snapshot of the last debug state (i.e not up to date).

Any questions or comments about this version to: urbanskaters@gmail.com
